Theme name:    Anchor Strata
Description:   A simple, minimalist template that actually began life as an unused redesign of n33.co (my personal site). Includes a (configurable) parallax background effect, Poptrox-powered lightbox gallery, a bunch of pre-styled elements, and Sass sources for the Sass-inclined.
